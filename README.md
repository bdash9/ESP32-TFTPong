# ESP32-TFTPong

Yep...Pong! Well sort of. This isn't a fully finished version.
The ball bounces and there are paddles and a score board that increases when the ball hits the wall.

To do:
  -Stop the score from increasing when the ball hits the paddle
  -Stop the paddle from "dissapearing" when the ball hits it. A black dot is written over the last postiion of the ball.
  -Finish the potentiometer controller code
